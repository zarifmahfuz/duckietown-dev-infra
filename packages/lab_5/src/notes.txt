Goal: Estimate the robot's position in the global frame with information from a local frame.
Global Frame: Robot's position with respect to some fixed point in space.
Local Frame: Robot's position with respect to some particular object.

Scene Setup
- Measure the position of the tags, in inches from your global origin.
- Determine the orientation of the tags in reference to your global coordinate system in terms of Euler angles. 
  Euler angles are a way to describe rotations in 3D and consist of 3 angles; X, Y and Z.

Detector
- Three important parameters for a Detector object: families, nthreads, quad-decimate

Pose Estimation
How to get the location of the camera in the global frame?
1. We get the location of the camera in the tag frame.
2. Combine (1) with the location of the tag in the global frame (known).
